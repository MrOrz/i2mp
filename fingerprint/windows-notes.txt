I recently wanted to get your matlab audio landmarking algorithm
working on a windows machine and thought I'd let you know of the traps
and fixes that were involved so you can let others know.

Firstly I had a problem with myls which I just replaced with a dir,
then struct2cell then (1,:) as I was working with offline files.

In mp3read and mp3info: The paths to mpg123.exe and mp3info.exe had to
be complete global paths. The same applies to the mp3 folder (despite
being included in Matlabs saved paths).

Also, Matlab 2004 doesn't have the 'first' flag for the unique method
(used in match_query.m) and so this will need to be replaced. Here I 
offer an alternative firstUnique.m that gets the same results:

function [B,M] = firstUnique(A)
% B is the unique elements in A
% M indexes the first instance of each so B = A(M)
B = unique(A);
M = zeros(size(B));
for ib = 1:length(B)
    M(ib) = min(find(A==B(ib)));
end
